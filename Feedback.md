## Feedback

1. Show an activity loader when API is getting called in BG
2. The choice of UX is not right. You added button on home screen. How would the user know what he/she is saving
3. The cache library you have pushed seems not be working. As of now, the App loads the image everytime and blocks the main thread (UI)
4. Load image from DB and not from URL. You should be storing base64 in DB for image


Stretched Goals
1. Make UI responsive in Landscape mode
